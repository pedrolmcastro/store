## 1. Requirements

The assignment is to build an online store and the products chosen to be sold are **computer components** and **peripherals**. The application must have two types of users (**customers** and **administrators**), a cart system and accept payments with credit cards. An extra functionality is also required so a **search bar** and a **categories menu** were added. Lastly, the system should provide accessibility requirements, good usability and be responsive.

- **User Information:** ID, name, password, email, phone, address and if is admin.
- **Product Information:** ID, name, category, summary, description, quantity, price and image.
- **Purchase Information:** ID, user, date, total price and a list of the products with ID, quantity and price paid.

> In the initial database entries there are 2 created accounts (`client@client.com/client` and `admin@admin.com/admin`), 5 products and 1 purchase.


## 2. Project Description

**Gaming Gem** is an online computer components and peripherals store focused on hardware for gaming. The website will be presented as a Single Page Application and its full Mockup can be seen in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ozZUSnOeuyotmszMJvDc2P/Vuetify-Components-(Community)?node-id=13144%3A605) on the "Store" page. A partial interactive one, including Login/Register, Home and Product Description, can be found in [Github Pages](https://pedrolmcastro.github.io/store/mockup/pages/home.html) and its source code in the [/mockup](https://github.com/pedrolmcastro/store/tree/main/mockup) directory.

- **Sections:** Login/Register, Home, Product Catalogue, Product Description, Cart, Payment, Profile, Manage Products/Users and Add/Edit Product.

> The above Navigation Diagram refers to the original plan in the mockup phase, since then one change has been made were the admin route for the Manage Products/Costumers page is separated from the one linking users to their profiles.


## 3. Comments About the Code

The client side was developed using Vue 3 with the following project structure: `App.vue` has the app template and general CSS styles, `Store.vue` holds global variables/functions and custom components are located under the `components/` or `pages/` directories.

The server side was implemented using Node and Express with MongoDB as the database management system, having the files at `models/` serving as the schemas and `scripts/populate.js` beign the initial data generator. The files under `routers/` specify the connection points and their actions, limiting the access to some of them using the auxiliar functions defined in the files inside `auth/`.

## 6. Build Procedures

First, make sure you have the project dependecies installed: [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) and [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Configure the docker and run the server side with the following commands:

```shell
cd backend/
npm install

docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name vue-mongo -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=admin mongo
docker start vue-mongo # Use this instead, if you previously created the instance

npm run populate
npm start
```

Now open the `frontend/dist/index.html` file in your browser to see the application running. To terminate the execution hit `Ctrl + C` in your server terminal.


## 7. Problems

During the frontend development, the group noticed that implementing a generic filter that worked with any product category would be outside of the scope of the project, so the bonus feature was reduced to be only the search by name/category. Also, Vuetify is not yet fully supported in Vue 3 so the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), [Maska](https://github.com/beholdr/maska), [Toggle](https://github.com/vueform/toggle), [VueCollapsiblePanel](https://github.com/dafcoe/vue-collapsible-panel) and [VueBurgerMenu](https://github.com/mbj36/vue-burger-menu) libraries were used as replacements.
