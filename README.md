## 1. Requirements

The assignment is to build an online store and the products chosen to be sold are **computer components** and **peripherals**. The application must have two types of users: **customers** and **administrators**, a cart system and accept payments with credit cards. An extra functionality is also required so a **search bar** and a **categories menu** were added. Lastly, the system should provide accessibility requirements, good usability and be responsive.

- **User Information:** ID, name, password, email, phone, address and if is admin.
- **Product Information:** ID, name, category, summary, description, quantity, price and image.
- **Purchase Information:** ID, user, date, total price and a list of the products with ID, quantity and price paid.

> In the frontend mock data there are 2 created accounts, `user@email.com/user` and `admin@email.com/admin`, 5 products and 1 purchase.


## 2. Project Description

**Gaming Gem** is an online computer components and peripherals store focused on hardware for gaming. The website will be presented as a Single Page Application and its full Mockup can be seen in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ozZUSnOeuyotmszMJvDc2P/Vuetify-Components-(Community)?node-id=13144%3A605) on the "Store" page. A partial interactive one, including Login/Register, Home and Product Description, can be found in [Github Pages](https://pedrolmcastro.github.io/store/mockup/pages/home.html) and its source code in the [/mockup](https://github.com/pedrolmcastro/store/tree/main/mockup) directory.

- **Sections:** Login/Register, Home, Product Catalogue, Product Description, Cart, Payment, Profile, Manage Products/Users and Add/Edit Product.

> The above Navigation Diagram refers to the original plan in the mockup phase, since then one change has been made were the admin route for the Manage Products/Costumers page is separated from the one linking users to their profiles.


## 3. Comments About the Code

The client side was developed using Vue 3 with the following project structure: `App.vue` has the app template and general CSS styles, `Store.vue` holds global variables and functions, the mock data are in `assets/datastore.js` and custom components are located under the `components/` or `pages/` directories. The server side will be implemented using Node and Express.


## 4. Test Plan

Since it requires user inputs through a graphic interface, no automated tests were created for the frontend side of the project, but the mock data are sufficient to allow reasonable manual testing. The Jest framework will be used for unit testing in the backend code base.

1. Use email "admin@email.com" and password "admin" to log in, click the **Settings Icon** and navigate between the **Products Section** and the **Users Section**.
1. Make the user "New" an admin, click the **Delete Icon** to delete the user "User" and hit **Ok**.
1. Click the **Delete Icon** in the "Ryzen R5 3600X" product listing and confirm, then hit the **Edit Icon** of the "Intel I5 11400F", raise its quantity to 3 and go to the **Home Page**.
1. Log out, try to log in with email "user@email.com" and password "user" and log in using email "new@email.com" and password "new".
1. Click the **Settings Icon** and hit the **Add Product Button**, inform the name "Mouse", the quantity 1, the price 10000 and the category "Mouse", open the **Burger Menu** and click the **Mouse Link** under the **Peripherals Division**.

## 6. Build Procedures
### Frontend

To run the client side of this website, we currently provide 2 options:

- Development server:
```shell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run serve
```
- Distribution folder:

Simply open the frontend/dist/index.html file.
### Backend

To run the backend of the application, you will need to have **docker** and **node** installed and then run the following commands:

```
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name vue-mongo \
  -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin \
  -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=admin \
  mongo

# if you already created the instance previously, use instead:
docker start vue-mongo

cd backend
npm install
npm run populate
npm start
```

PS: For simplicity sake we already set mongoose to run with these exact Mongo configurations. If you want to use a Mongo instance with different credentials you can alter the mongoose.connect(...) command found on backend/scripts/populate.js and backend/index.js

Now you will be able to see the application running on your browser by accessing the [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/). To terminate the execution hit `Ctrl + C` in your terminal.


## 7. Problems

During the frontend development, the group noticed that implementing a generic filter that worked with any product category would be outside of the scope of the project, so the bonus feature was reduced to be only the search by name/category. Also, Vuetify is not yet fully supported in Vue 3 so the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), [Maska](https://github.com/beholdr/maska), [Toggle](https://github.com/vueform/toggle), [VueCollapsiblePanel](https://github.com/dafcoe/vue-collapsible-panel) and [VueBurgerMenu](https://github.com/mbj36/vue-burger-menu) libraries were used as replacements.
